# old-projects
Some old projects, there are some bugs but I don't have access to delphi so i cant fix them.
I think _MathMagician_, _Snake_ and _Connect_4_ have incorrect file handeling so they dont properly close the textfiles they create/interact with because I didn't know how to properly handle files when I made those.
