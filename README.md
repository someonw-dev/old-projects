# old-projects
Some old projects, the code has some problems but I don't have access to delphi so i cant fix some of the bugs.
I think _MathMagician_, _Snake_ and _Connect_4_ have incorrect file handeling so they dont properly close the textfiles they create because I didn't know how to properly handle files when I made those.
